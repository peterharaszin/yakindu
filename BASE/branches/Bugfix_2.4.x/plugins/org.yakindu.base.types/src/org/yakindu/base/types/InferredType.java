/**
 * Representation of an inferred type, which is formed by a {@link Type} and a
 * set of {@link TypeConstraint}s.
 * <p>
 * Note that the {@link Type} included in an {@link InferredType} does not
 * necessarily have to be a concrete type that is provided via
 * {@link ITypeSystem#getTypes()}, and should thus never be used by clients
 * directly. In fact, the it may be an (abstract) type that is used by an
 * {@link ITypeSystem} for purposes of type inference only. As an example
 * consider a type system that offers a set of different integer types, which
 * have different value ranges (modeled by {@link TypeConstraint}s) but no
 * common base type. In such a case, the {@link ITypeSystem} may synthesize an
 * abstract integer base type and use it during type inference (together with
 * {@link TypeConstraint}s that narrow the range of supported values). In the
 * end, {@link ITypeSystem#getTypes(InferredType))} may then use the synthesized
 * integer base type (and the computed constraints) to decide which of its
 * concrete integer types may be used and return them to the client.
