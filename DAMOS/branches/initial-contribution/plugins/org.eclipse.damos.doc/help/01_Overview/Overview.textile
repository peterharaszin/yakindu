h1. Overview

The Damos project provides a modeling environment for modeling systems using a data flow-oriented approach. Such systems can be (but are not limited to) software systems, hardware systems (e.g. mechanical systems), or physical systems -- or a combination of those. Even though data flow-oriented design is not bound to a specific domain, it is most commonly used in control systems engineering and digital signal processing (DSP).

Damos includes the following features:

* a graphical block diagram editor (model editor)
* a simulator utilizing fixed-step size and adaptive-step size solvers to simulate continuous-time and discrete-time systems
* a C code generator to transform models into executable code
* extension points to customize and extend the functionality of the modeling environment
