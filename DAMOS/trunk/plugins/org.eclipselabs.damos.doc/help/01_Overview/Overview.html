Such systems can be (but are not limited to) software systems, hardware systems (e.g. mechanical systems), or physical systems &#8212; or a combination of those. Even though data flow-oriented design is not bound to a specific domain, it is most commonly used in control systems engineering and digital signal processing (DSP).</p><p>Damos includes the following features:</p><ul><li>a graphical block diagram editor (model editor)</li><li>a simulator utilizing fixed-step size and adaptive-step size solvers to simulate continuous-time and discrete-time systems</li><li>a C code generator to transform models into executable code</li><li>extension points to customize and extend the functionality of the modeling environment</li></ul></body></html>
