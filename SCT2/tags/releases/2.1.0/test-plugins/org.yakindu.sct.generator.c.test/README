Executing the C tests.

Preconditions:

In order to run the C test the google test framework (gtest) must be installed.

To locate the required gtest headers and libraries the environment variable 'GTEST_DIR' is used. 
This directory has to contain the 'gtest' and 'gtest_main' libs as well as the folder 'includes' 
that has to contain the required header files.

If no environment variable is set then the test try to find the headers at the default systems header and library locations.

Please consult the gtest documentation for installation and build instructions (cmake based build seems to fit best).



Running the tests:

The C tests are wrapped by Junit tests. Simply run these as Junit-Plugin tests and make sure that the PermGenSpace is big enough ( -XX:MaxPermSize=256m ).

Running as plugin tests is necessary since several resources required for the test are loaded from the plugin bundle.
