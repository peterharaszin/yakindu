	 *            Note: This happens address defect RATLC00522324. For our
	 *            topgraphical edit parts we delagate the direct edit request to
	 *            a primary edit part and set focus on that. The issue is that
	 *            if the user has typed in an initial character when setting
	 *            focus to the edit part, which typically is a
	 *            TextCompartmentEditPart then setting that intial value does
	 *            not fire the necessary change events that need to occur in
	 *            order for that value to be recongnized. If you don't use this
	 *            method then the result is that if you just type in the initial
	 *            character and that is it then the text compartment loses focus
	 *            then the value will not be saved. This is because setting the
	 *            value of the cell doesn't think its value has changed since
	 *            the first character is not recongized as a change.
