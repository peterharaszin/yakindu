It is based on the open source development platform Eclipse. The YAKINDU Statechart tools provide the following tools to deal with state machine diagramms:</p><ul><li><strong>YAKINDU SCT editor</strong> to create and edit state charts</li><li><strong>YAKINDU simulator</strong> to simulate the behavior of state charts</li><li><strong>YAKINDU Xpand generator projects</strong> to create a transformation of the state chart in Xpand</li><li><strong>YAKINDU Xtend/Java generator projects</strong> to create a transformation in Xtend/Java</li><li>integrated validation</li></ul><p>The following graph shows these features and their relation to each other:</p><p><img border="0" src="images/YAKINDU_features.png"/> </p><h2 id="WhoisbehindYAKINDUStatechartTools2">Who is behind YAKINDU Statechart Tools 2?</h2><p>The main part of YAKINDU SCT 2 is an open source project (<a href="http://www.yakindu.org">www.yakindu.org</a> ). Most of the developers work for itemis, a well known consulting company specialized on model based development.  </p><p>You may ask: Where does the money for Open-Source development come from? Well, we provide professional services around Yakindu. Be it training or on-site consulting, be it development of prototypes or implementation of full-blown IDEs for programming languages. We do not only know the framework very well but we are also experts in programming and domain-specific language design.
