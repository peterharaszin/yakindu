h1. Getting started

h2. Installation

h3. Prerequisites

The *Yakindu Statechart Tools 2* are built upon Java and Xtext. So you need to have installed a "Java Runtime Environment":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html and Xtext installed. The easier way to get this is to install the "pre configured Xtext contribution":http://xtext.itemis.com.

The *Yakindu Statechart Tools 2* need *Eclipse Indigo 3.7* or higher and *Xtext 2.0.1* exactly (no higher) to work correctly.

h3. Installing the YAKINDU-Plug-Ins

You install the Yakindu Plug-Ins from the update site: http://updates.yakindu.com/indigo/milestones. 

* Choose *Help* -> *Install new software...* from the menu bar and _Add.._ the update site *Yakindu SCT2 milestones* - http://updates.yakindu.com/indigo/milestones/
* On this update site you find two main items:
** Xtext integration utilities
*** Xtext GMF integration (XGI)
*** Xtext JFace integration (XJI)
*** Yakindu Base
** Yakindu SCT 2
*** Generator C
*** Generator Java
*** Yakindu SCT 2
*** Yakindu SCT 2 SDK

The Xtext integration utilities provide Xtext functionality for Yakindu. Additionally to the base integration also GMF and JFace integration is provided here. For more details check the parts "XGI":#XGI and "XJI":#XJI.

Under Yakindu SCT 2 you can select what code generators you need and if you need the Yakindu SCT2 SDK (for developers). For users only the Yakindu SCT 2 is sufficient.

h2. Yakindu SC Modeling perspective

For state machine modeling purposes open the Yakindu *SC Modeling* perspective by choosing *Window* - *Open Perspective* - *SC Modeling*. This perspective is optimized for statechart modeling. It consists of 
* <a href="PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cnav.htm">Project Explorer</a> on the left
* <a href="PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/coutline.htm">Outline</a> View on the right
* YAKINDU Statechart Editor at the top
* <a href="PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cprbview.htm">Problems</a> and <a href="PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cpropview.htm">Properties View</a> at the bottom

h2. Yakindu SC Simulation perspective

To simulate a state machine use the Yakindu *SC Simulation* perspective by choosing *Window* - *Open Perspective* - *SC Simulation*. This perspective is optimized for simulation purposes and consists of:

* <a href="PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cnav.htm">Project Explorer</a> on the left
* <a href="PLUGIN_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/coutline.htm">Outline</a> view on the right top
* Simulation View on the right bottom
* Debug view at the top
* YAKINDU Statechart Editor at the bottom

h2. Yakindu Xpand Generator Project

In the context of model driven software development generators play an important role. The generator transforms the model to either another model or text like code. Yakindu generators can be writen in different languages. One is Xpand. By choosing *File* - *New* - *Other...* - *YAKINDU Xpand Generator Project* you create a project optimized for writing a generator in Xpand. For more details regarding Xpand see <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.xpand.doc/help/index.html">Xpand Documentation</a>.

All you need to do is to give it a speaking name and click *Finish*. The setting *Configure for Plugin Export* is an option for plugin developers and can be neglected here.
