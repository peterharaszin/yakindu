Thus, they support all structural model elements as defined by the UML specification, which are States (orthogonal and hierarchical), Regions, Transitions and Pseudo States (History, Deep History, Initial, Final, Choice, Join / Fork).<br/>In addition, Yakindu Statechart Models specify interfaces that define the interaction of the state machine with its environment. Besides some more advanced concepts like Entry / Exit Points, an interface basically consists of in and out Events as well as Variables including types. These well-defined statechart interfaces are especially useful in the<br/>context of component models and product line engineering.</p><p>For defining interfaces and modeling the dynamic aspects of statecharts (triggers, guards and actions) SCT provides a statically typed, textual action language called <strong>SText</strong>. It tightly integrates into the graphical editor and supports the user with code completion, syntax highlighting, cross referencing and validation during modeling.</p><h2 id="Simulation">Simulation</h2><p>Yakindu Statechart Models can be executed via an integrated simulation engine. The simulation engine supports two different types of execution semantics, cycle based and event driven execution. The default execution semantic is cycle based which executes a statechart cycle within a fixed period of time and thus allows processing of concurrent events. In contrast, the event based approach executes a statechart cycle as soon as an event occurred.</p><p>During simulation, the currently active states and the transition path including the previous states are highlighted in the editor for visual debugging. An additional view<br/>shows the variable values and allows to raise events. </p><p>Apart from that, the engine uses a virtual time during simulation. The user can provide a time scaling factor that is multiplied with the real time. This is especially useful during debugging, if the statechart model contains very tight or long running time triggers.</p><h2 id="CodeGeneration">Code Generation</h2><p>Yakindu Statechart Tools currently support the generation of Java, C and C++ Code.  All generators can be customized with a generator model. This is a textual model file where generator features, like the execution type (event or cycle based), or the interface styles (static or generic), can be specified. The code generation process can either be executed with a builder that starts code generation on resource change or manually with a context menu action.</p><h2 id="Domainspecificadaptability">Domain specific adaptability</h2><p>Yakindu Statechart Tools were developed with a domain specific adaptability in mind. Several extension points allow the customization of all mentioned aspects. It is possible to contribute a custom type system or custom action languages which may be a dialect of SText or a complete new language.</p><p>Also, the different code generators can be customized or new code generators for other target languages can be plugged in easily.</p></body></html>
