h2. Simulating Operations With Custom Java Code

To simulate a model with operations it is possible to use custom Java code that mocks the desired behavior or even to simulate against an existing java backend. 
For that to work, it is required to provide one or more custom java classes having a method with a matching signature. 


!images/operationsExample.png!

To simulate the statechart above, a new Java Class must be created matching the method signature defined in the statechart. This class must be placed onto the classpath of the
statecharts project. 
 
bc(prettyprint). 
package example;
public class Calculator {
   public int add(int param1, int param2) {
      return param1 + param2;
   }
}


This custom class can be passed to the run configuration as *Operation Class*, shown in the figure below. It is possible to pass multiple java classes seperated by a comma.
If the simulation is executed, the variable result gets the value 2.

h2. Generating Code

For configuring the code generation process, YAKINDU Statechart Tools uses a textual generator model called *SGen*. It can be created either by using the provided wizard *Yakindu Statechart Generator Model* or by creating a new text file with the file extension '.sgen'.
To create a generator model with the wizard,

# Click *File* > *New* > *Other...* > *Yakindu Statechart Generator Model*
# Type a name and click *Next*
# Choose the desired generator, i.e. *YAKINDU Java Code Generator*
# Check the model(s) to generate code from and click *Finish*

!images/genmodelwizardchooselanguage.jpg!

The result is an .sgen file of the following format: 
 
bc(prettyprint).. 
GeneratorModel for [GeneratorId] {
	statechart [StatechartReference] {
		feature [Feature] {
			[ParameterName] = [ParameterValue]
		}
	}
}
 
p. The [GeneratorId] is the unique id of the Generator. Currently, the following Generators are supported out of the box:

# yakindu::java - Generator ID for the Java Code Generator 
# yakindu::c - Generator ID for the C Code Generator
# yakindu::xpand - Generator ID for custom Xpand based Code Generators
# yakindu::generic - Generator ID for custom Java based Code Generators  

One GeneratorModel can contain several [StatechartReference]s. These are cross references to statechart models for which the code should be generated. For each reference, the generator process can be configured with [Feature]s. Each Feature consists of several parameters. These parameters can be configured with [ParameterName] = [ParameterValue].
 
The Generator Model is executed by a builder. Thus, the artifacts are generated automatically if *Project* > *Build Automatically* is checked. If you want to execute your Generator Model by hand, select *Generate Statechart Artifacts* from the *Package Explorer's* context menu.

h2. Create custom code generators

Although Yakindu Statechart Tools is shipped with powerful code generators for C, C++ and Java out of the box it may be necessary to create a custom code generator to support different use cases. One reason for a custom code generator could be to support additional programming languages (In this case we would be happy about a contribution! :-)) or to generate code for an existing framework. 

h3. Prerequisites

Implementing a custom code generator is not a trivial task. Before you get started, you should have a basic understanding about the "Eclipse Modeling Framework":https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/ that we use to structure our data model. 
Furthermore, we highly recommend to use "Xtend":http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/ as the template language for your code generator although plain old Java is still supported. Xtend provides some great features like "Template Expressions":http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation.html#templates, 
"Lambdas":http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation.html#lambdas and and "Polymorphic Method Invocation":http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation.html#polymorphicDispatch that boosts readability and productivity. 

h3. Creating a new code generator project

Creating custom code generators is a first level concept in Yakindu Statechart Tools. It is not required to set up a developer workspace with the Statechart Tools source code and to start a new eclipse runtime to test your generator changes. Instead you can develop and test your custom generator at runtime! To set up a new generator project select *File* > *New* > *Other* > *Yakindu* > *Xtend2/Java Generator Project* and click next.

!images/xtendwizard.png!

The wizard for configuring a generator projects opens. Specify a *project name* and the name of the *generator class* like shown in the example above and check the *Use Xtend* checkbox. If you plan to export your custom generator as a single eclipse plugin to deploy it to different Yakindu Statechart Tools Installations, you should check the *configure plugin for export* checkbox. The Generator Id, Name and Description is then used to make your generator accessible after export from within a Generator Model (see chapter Generating Code). The *create feature library* checkbox allows the contribution of custom generator fragments to the generator model. This is an advanced topic and you should ignore it for now. Press finish to close the wizard.

!images/generatornavigator.png!

Voilà! The wizard created a new generator project with for you with the structure as shown above. The *CustomGenerator.xtend* contains a simple default code generator that simply prints the name of the statechart and all of its states to the target file.

h3. Executing the custom code generator

To test your custom code generator, create a new Project with a Yakindu Statechart Tools Model as described in the getting started tutorial chapter *Create a statechart model* (TODO link).
After that, create a new generator model as described in chapter *Generating code*. As the desired generator, choose the *Custom Xtend2/Java based code generator*. As you may have noticed, the generator model for the yakindu::generic generator contains an additional feature called *Generator*. This is where you should specify the name of your custom generator project and the full qualified generator class name as shown below. 

bc(prettyprint).. 
GeneratorModel for yakindu::generic {
	statechart MyStatechart {
		feature Outlet {
			targetProject = "SCTExample"
			targetFolder = "src-gen"
		}
		feature Generator {
			generatorProject = "MyCustomGenerator"
			generatorClass = "org.yakindu.CustomGenerator"
		}
	}
}

p. If you right click the sgen file and select "Generate Statechart Artifacts" from the context menu
the generator is executed and creates a new file *src-gen/MyStatechart.txt* with the following content.

bc(prettyprint).. 
The name of the Statemachine is 'MyStatechart'
The Statemachine has the following states:
main_region.A
main_region.B

p. Congratulations, you successfully created a custom generator project! Add 

bc. 
The Statemachine contains «flow.states.size» states

to the *CustomGenerator.xtend* and regenerate. The result in *MyStatechart.txt* is updated immediately. This is a very powerful feature of Yakindu Statechart Tools. You can develop your code generator with zero turn around time without the need to restart your workbench or redeploying plugins. Just hit *generate* and see the result.


h3. Different meta models for different use cases
