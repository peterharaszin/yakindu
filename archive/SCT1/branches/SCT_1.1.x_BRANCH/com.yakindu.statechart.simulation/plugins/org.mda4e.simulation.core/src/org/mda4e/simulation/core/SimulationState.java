 * The simulation states define the possible states of a {@link ISimulationEngine}.

 * <b>The right lifecycle:</b><br>
 * 
 * The initial state of the engine is {@link #STOPPED}. If the simulation is
 * started for the first time the following states are possible:
 * {@link #RUNNING}, {@link #PAUSED} and {@link #STOPPED}. If the simulation
 * engine is disposed the state {@link #DISPOSED} must be enabled, because
 * controllers often have a reference on the engine object and with the 
 * possibility to check the engine state (independent of state events) they
 * can remove this.
 * </p>
