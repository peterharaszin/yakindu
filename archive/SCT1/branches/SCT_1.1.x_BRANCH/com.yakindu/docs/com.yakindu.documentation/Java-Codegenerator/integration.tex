\section{Integrating Generated Java Code}

A demonstration example that reflects the integration of the Java code,
generated for the \emph{TrafficLight} example with manually written code is
deployed with the YAKINDU Statechart tools and may be created using the
example wizard as outlined by Figures \ref{fig:screenshot17} and
\ref{fig:screenshot18}.

As depicted by Figure \ref{fig:screenshot19} it contains some manually written
code (within the \texttt{src} folder) that realizes a Draw2d visualization of
a traffic light, being adapted (within the \texttt{CrossingDemo} main class)
to the generated source code of the \emph{TrafficLight} example (contained in
the \texttt{src-gen} folder of the example project).

As outlined in Figures \ref{fig:screenshot20} and \ref{fig:screenshot21}, the
\texttt{CrossingDemo} main class within the example project may be executed as
a Java application. It shows a visualization of the \emph{TrafficLight} state
chart variable values (by means of colors of the traffic and pedestrian lights
contained) and offers a button group, which prolongs respectively named events
to the \emph{TrafficLight} state chart.
