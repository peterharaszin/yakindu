ContextProvider_viewhelp = The Yakindu Statemachine View shows all variables and events of the currently chosen statemachine simulation. It allows to edit all variables apart from the outputs and to fire or deactivate events.\n\nNote: The deactivation of an event is only possible If it was not processed by the simulation engine yet, so it is recommended to start the simulation in the single step mode to use this feature.\n\nThe different simulation engines can be identified with the name of the state diagram and the instance number of the statemachine. This can be helpful, if several instances of the same statechart exist in one simulation system.\n\n\nLegend:\n\n    green cell:    the value was changed to a value unequal to 0.0\n    yellow cell:    the value was set to 0.0\n    bold text:    the state of the event was changed
