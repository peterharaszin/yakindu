/**
 * The interface <code>ISimulationController</code> is implemented by classes which
 * acts as a (passive) controller of simulation engines (<code>ISimulationEngine</code>).
 * The characteristics of a controller are that it is able to react to events, to control
 * the simulation engine and to read simulation specific informations. An example for
 * a passive controller is a visualization tool that displays the simulation state.
 * Another example is a plug-in which acts as simulation controller to start and stop
 * the simulation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> The implementation of the interface {@link EventDispatcher} allows a
 * controller to signals the execution unit that an error was occurred. For more
 * informations see: {@link ControllerEvent}. 
 * </p>
