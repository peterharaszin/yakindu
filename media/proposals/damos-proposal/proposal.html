<p>This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse
community. Please send all feedback to the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/eclipse.proposals">Eclipse Proposals</a>
Forum.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<!-- 
	Optionally provide the background that has lead you to creating this project.
 -->

<p>In the field of science and engineering, data flow-oriented modeling is commonly used for analyzing and designing systems.
On the one hand it allows scientists and engineers to focus on the data processing aspects of a system,
and on the other hand it provides a means to specify the dynamics of the mechanical components and the physical environment of the system to
facilitate close-to-real-world system simulation.</p>

<p>Since many scientists and engineers already utilize Eclipse for software development using CDT, DSDP, and other technologies,
it would be beneficial to perform system modeling, simulation, and code generation in Eclipse rather than in an external tool.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<!-- 
	All projects must have a well-defined scope. Describe, concisely, what
	is in-scope and (optionally) what is out-of-scope. An Eclipse project
	cannot have an open-ended scope.
 -->
 
This project will provide a data flow-oriented modeling environment. 
Furthermore, it will provide support to derive own data flow-oriented languages based on the structural and diagram editing components of this project.

<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe the project here. Be concise, but provide enough information that
	somebody who doesn't already know very much about your project idea or domain
	has at least a fighting chance of understanding its purpose.
 -->

<p>The goal of this project is to provide a modeling environment for analyzing and designing systems using a data flow-oriented approach.
Such system models are usually comprised of software components (e.g. control algorithm), mechanical components, and the physical environment.
Even though data flow-oriented design is not bound to a specific domain,
it is most commonly used in control systems engineering and digital signal processing.</p>

<h2>Why Eclipse?</h2> 

<!-- 
	Answer these two questions:	What value does this project bring to the Eclipse
	community? What value do you expect to obtain from hosting your project at Eclipse?
	
	What value do you get by having your project at Eclipse over and above the value
	of hosting at Eclipse Labs?
 -->

<h2>Initial Contribution</h2>

<!-- 
	Projects are expected to arrive at Eclipse with existing code.
	
	Describe the existing code that will be contributed to the project. Please provide
	a couple of paragraphs describing the code with modest detail, including important
	information like code ownership (who holds the copyright?), and some consideration
	of community that exists around the code. Include a listing of third-party libraries 
	and associated licenses.
 -->

<p>The initial contribution consists of sources found in the current Damos repository at <a href="http://eclipselabs.org/p/yakindu">EclipseLabs</a>.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

<p>In order to facilitate customization, Damos is split into a set of top-level components (i.e. Eclipse features).
There are two main groups of components. The first group contains components providing the structural semantics
and the diagram editing features of the modeling environment (orange).
The second group provides simulation and code generation components as well as the standard block library (green).
This enables other projects to build their own data flow-oriented languages by reusing the structural semantics
and diagram editing components, and without being required to ship unneeded components.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Main Components</h3>

<h4>Models</h4>

<p>EMF-based models are used to specify the semantics of data flow-oriented systems.
This enables users to perform model analysis and transformation using well-known Eclipse modeling technologies.<p>

<p>System models are comprised of models describing the mechanical components and the physical environment of a device,
and the software model that will later be executed on that device.
These models are described graphically using block diagrams.</p>

<p>When performing model simulation or code generation, an execution flow is first derived from the system model.
The execution flow contains the execution graphs (i.e. the execution order of system components) of the system model.
The execution-specific configuration must be provided in an execution model.
The simulation and the code generation models are used to configure the simulation process (e.g. solver configuration)
and the code generator (e.g. target directories), respectively.
The computation model specifies the computation algorithms utilized in the target device (e.g. fixed-point arithmetic vs. floating-point arithmetic).</p>

<p>Damos provides a GMF-based graphical block diagram editor for the system model.
For all other models, textual model editors based on Xtext are provided.</p>

<p><img src="models.png"/></p>

<h4>Block Diagram Editor</h4>

<p>The graphical block diagram editor is used for editing system models.
It can also be used to visualize real-time simulation results using virtual instruments.</p>

<p><a href="block-diagram-editor.png"><img src="block-diagram-editor-small.png"/></a></p>

<h4>Simulation Environment</h4>

<p>The simulation environment utilizes adaptive and fixed step size solvers to simulate continuous systems.
It also provides asynchronous and real-time simulation capabilities.</p>

<h4>Code Generator</h4>

<p>The code generation tooling initially includes a standard compliant C code generator.</p>

<h4>Block Library</h4>

<p>The standard block library contains commonly used blocks.
If required, the user is able to define his/her own blocks.
This can be done using the declarative programming language Mscript, which is part of this project.</p>

<h4>Extension Mechanisms</h4>

<p>Extension mechanisms can be used to customize and extend various aspects of the tooling.</p>

<h2>Legal Issues</h2>

<!-- 
	Please describe any potential legal issues in this section. Does somebody else
	own the trademark to the project name? Is there some issue that prevents you
	from licensing the project under the Eclipse Public License? Are parts of the 
	code available under some other license? Are there any LGPL/GPL bits that you
	absolutely require?
 -->
 
<h2>Committers</h2>

<!-- 
	List any initial committers that should be provisioned along with the
	new project. Include affiliation, but do not include email addresses at
	this point.
 -->

<p>The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to the project:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Committer 1, Affiliation</dt>
	<dd>Committer 1 is a committer on the *** project where he has made significant contributions over
	many years. S/he will be contribute to the *** functionality in this new project.</dd>
	<dt>Committer 2, Affiliation</dt>
	<dd>Committer 2 has provided significant contributions to the existing code base. S/he will contribute
	to the *** functionality in this new project.
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>We welcome additional committers and contributions.</p>

<!-- 
	Describe any initial contributions of code that will be brought to the 
	project. If there is no existing code, just remove this section.
 -->

<h2>Mentors</h2>

<!-- 
	New Eclipse projects require a minimum of two mentors from the Architecture
	Council. You need to identify two mentors before the project is created. The
	proposal can be posted before this section is filled in (it's a little easier
	to find a mentor when the proposal itself is public).
 -->

<p>The following Architecture Council members will mentor this
project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mentor 1</li>
	<li>Mentor 2</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested Parties</h2>

<!-- 
	Provide a list of individuals, organisations, companies, and other Eclipse
	projects that are interested in this project. This list will provide some
	insight into who your project's community will ultimately include. Where
	possible, include affiliations. Do not include email addresses.
 -->

<p>The following individuals, organisations, companies and projects have 
expressed interest in this project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Somebody, Affiliation</li>
	<li>Somebody else, Affiliation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Scheduling</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe, in rough terms, what the basic scheduling of the project will
	be. You might, for example, include an indication of when an initial contribution
	should be expected, when your first build will be ready, etc. Exact
	dates are not required.
