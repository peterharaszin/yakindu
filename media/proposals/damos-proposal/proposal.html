<p>This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse
community. Please send all feedback to the

<h2>Background</h2>

<!-- 
	Optionally provide the background that has lead you to creating this project.
 -->
<p>Nowadays companies in the field of engineering are more and more struggling with the
increasing software complexity of their systems.
Engineers who were used to focus merely on physical and technical aspects of a system
now need to deal with software engineering issues.
The time pressure due to time-to-market constraints and the fact that many engineers
are not adequately trained to handle such complex software structures lead to poor software quality,
which results in less maintainable code&mdash;and more importantly&mdash;in an increase of system malfunctions.</p>

<p>To get a grip on the software complexity, a model-driven engineering approach becomes common practice.
Since many engineers already utilize Eclipse for embedded software development using CDT, DSDP, and other technologies,
it would be beneficial to perform system modeling, simulation, and code generation in Eclipse rather than in an external tool.</p>

<p>In the field of engineering, data flow-oriented designs are commonly used.
On the one hand it allows engineers to focus on the data processing aspects of a technical system,
and on the other hand it provides a means to specify the physical environment of the system to
facilitate system simulation.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<!-- 
	All projects must have a well-defined scope. Describe, concisely, what
	is in-scope and (optionally) what is out-of-scope. An Eclipse project
	cannot have an open-ended scope.
 -->
This project will provide:
<ul>

<li>Ecore models for specifying the semantics of data flow-oriented systems.
This enables users to perform model analysis and transformation using well-known Eclipse modeling technologies.</li>

<li>A graphical block diagram editor for editing system models.
This editor will also be used to visualize real-time simulation results using virtual instruments.</li>

<li>A simulation environment that utilizes adaptive and fixed step size solvers to simulate continuous systems.
It will also provide asynchronous and real-time simulation capabilities.</li>

<li>Code generation tooling, which will initially include a C code generator.</li>

<li>Standard block library containing commonly used blocks.
If required, the user will be able to define his/her own blocks.
This can be done using a declarative programming language, which will be part of this project.</li>

<li>Extension mechanisms to customize and extend various aspects of the tooling.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe the project here. Be concise, but provide enough information that
	somebody who doesn't already know very much about your project idea or domain
	has at least a fighting chance of understanding its purpose.
 -->

<p>The goal of this project is to provide a modeling environment for modeling systems using a data flow-oriented approach.
Such system models are usually comprised of software components (e.g. control algorithm), mechanical components,
and the physical environment.
Even though data flow-oriented design is not bound to a specific domain,
it is most commonly used in control systems engineering and digital signal processing.</p>

<h2>Why Eclipse?</h2> 

<!-- 
	Answer these two questions:	What value does this project bring to the Eclipse
	community? What value do you expect to obtain from hosting your project at Eclipse?
	
	What value do you get by having your project at Eclipse over and above the value
	of hosting at Eclipse Labs?
 -->

<h2>Initial Contribution</h2>

<!-- 
	Projects are expected to arrive at Eclipse with existing code.
	
	Describe the existing code that will be contributed to the project. Please provide
	a couple of paragraphs describing the code with modest detail, including important
	information like code ownership (who holds the copyright?), and some consideration
	of community that exists around the code. Include a listing of third-party libraries 
	and associated licenses.
 -->
 
<h2>Legal Issues</h2>

<!-- 
	Please describe any potential legal issues in this section. Does somebody else
	own the trademark to the project name? Is there some issue that prevents you
	from licensing the project under the Eclipse Public License? Are parts of the 
	code available under some other license? Are there any LGPL/GPL bits that you
	absolutely require?
 -->
 
<h2>Committers</h2>

<!-- 
	List any initial committers that should be provisioned along with the
	new project. Include affiliation, but do not include email addresses at
	this point.
 -->

<p>The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to the project:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Committer 1, Affiliation</dt>
	<dd>Committer 1 is a committer on the *** project where he has made significant contributions over
	many years. S/he will be contribute to the *** functionality in this new project.</dd>
	<dt>Committer 2, Affiliation</dt>
	<dd>Committer 2 has provided significant contributions to the existing code base. S/he will contribute
	to the *** functionality in this new project.
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>We welcome additional committers and contributions.</p>

<!-- 
	Describe any initial contributions of code that will be brought to the 
	project. If there is no existing code, just remove this section.
 -->

<h2>Mentors</h2>

<!-- 
	New Eclipse projects require a minimum of two mentors from the Architecture
	Council. You need to identify two mentors before the project is created. The
	proposal can be posted before this section is filled in (it's a little easier
	to find a mentor when the proposal itself is public).
 -->

<p>The following Architecture Council members will mentor this
project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mentor 1</li>
	<li>Mentor 2</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested Parties</h2>

<!-- 
	Provide a list of individuals, organisations, companies, and other Eclipse
	projects that are interested in this project. This list will provide some
	insight into who your project's community will ultimately include. Where
	possible, include affiliations. Do not include email addresses.
 -->

<p>The following individuals, organisations, companies and projects have 
expressed interest in this project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Somebody, Affiliation</li>
	<li>Somebody else, Affiliation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Scheduling</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe, in rough terms, what the basic scheduling of the project will
	be. You might, for example, include an indication of when an initial contribution
	should be expected, when your first build will be ready, etc. Exact
	dates are not required.
