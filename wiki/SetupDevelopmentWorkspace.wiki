#summary Step-by-step description for setting up a developer workspace.

= How to setup your developer workspace =

  * In your eclipse configure a svn repository for http://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/yakindu/ (username and password are your google code credentials)
  * Checkout following projects 
    * BASE/trunk/de.itemis.gmf.utils
    * BASE/trunk/de.itemis.xtext.utils
    * BASE/trunk/releng/org.yakindu.base.target    
    * all from BASE/trunk/plugins
    * all from SCT2/trunk/plugins
  * Set the target platform to org.yakindu.base.target/kepler.target
    * Open the target file and click on the link for setting the target platform (takes some minutes the first time)
  * Build relevant Xtext grammars
    * Rightclick on org.yakindu.base.expressions/Expressions.xtext => Run As.. => Generate Xtext Artifacts
    * Rightclick on org.yakindu.sct.stext/SText.xtext => Run As.. => Generate Xtext Artifacts
    * For this you need either the plugin SCT2/trunk/test-plugins/org.yakindu.sct.stext.test to be in your workspace or you need to deactivate the line 'pathTestProject = "${runtimeProject}.test"' in GenerateSText.mwe2

After these steps all projects should be error-free. To launch a runtime instance which has these projects as installed plugins, just right-click on a project => Run As => Eclipse Application
